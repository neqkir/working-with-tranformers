(1) `bart-text-summarization.ipynb` --> a jupyter notebook to get started with bart summarization and `bart-text-summarization.py` its python edition

(2) `fine-tuning-bart-summarization.py`--> we feed bart with some examples (13.000) of summarizations, i.e., we fine-tune on the summarization task 

we get good results after training for 10 EPOCHs
