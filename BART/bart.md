(1) `bart-text-summarization.ipynb` --> a jupyter notebook to get started with bart summarization and `bart-text-summarization.py` its python edition

(2) `fine-tuning-bart-summarization.py`--> we feed bart with some examples (13.000) of summarizations, i.e., we fine-tune on the summarization task 

we get good results after training for 10 EPOCHs for instance

text : "Migration flows from Latin American, African and Asian countries to Europe have shown that a high percentage of arriving individuals may be chronically infected with Strongyloides stercoralis, which may have a public health impact in non-endemic countries that are hosting these populations [1,2]. The infection is ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical areas, although it may also occur in temperate countries with appropriate conditions such as certain areas of Spain or Italy [3,4,5]. Worldwide estimates based on standard fecal techniques have suggested that between 30 and 100 million people are infected worldwide. These figures may be underestimates due to the low sensitivity of traditional diagnostic methods [1,6].
Unlike other parasitic infections, this helminth has some characteristics that are of particular importance for migrant populations [7]. Firstly, the infection can persist for the whole lifetime due to the possibility of causing autoinfection in the human host [8]. Through this phenomenon, the filariform larvae penetrate intestinal mucosa in the large intestine or perianal skin and migrate to complete another lifecycle. Therefore, people coming from endemic areas may be at risk for their whole life, irrespective of the moment they arrive in a non-endemic area, as long as they are not treated. Secondly, Strongyloides stercoralis infection is generally asymptomatic or causes unspecific symptoms, and thus goes unnoticed by health professionals who are not looking for it [9]. Thirdly, although the infection is rarely transmitted from person to person [10], it can be transmitted through organ transplantation, and autochthonous cases have been reported in non-endemic areas [11]. Therefore, screening should be considered for potential donors at risk of the infection [12,13,14]. Finally, in the case of immunosuppression, particularly those displaying a concomitant use of steroids, transplant recipients, or patients with malignancies and Human T-Cell Lymphotropic virus-1 co-infections, the parasite may enter into a high replicating cycle (called hyperinfection) or disseminate to vital organs (disseminated strongyloidiasis), causing a severe disease with a high mortality [15].
The diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in non-endemic areas is currently based on a serological test, which has a considerably higher sensitivity compared with standard fecal techniques [8]. Despite having cross-reactions with other helminthic infections, this is less likely to occur in migrant populations since the possibility of co-infections is lower [16] and it is thus now the current recommended screening technique for these populations [17]. The sensitivity of the serological tests in immunosuppressed individuals seems to be lower [18], but only limited data are available and further prospective studies should better evaluate the accuracy of serological tests in immunosuppressed patients.
Even with the limitations of current diagnostic methods, the screening of high-risk groups and treatment of infected individuals are of key importance. In this regard, the screening of strongyloidiasis in newly arrived migrants has been recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [19,20], particularly in immunosuppressed individuals, given the potential individual morbidity and mortality [16].
Evidence of the seroprevalence of strongyloidiasis in migrant populations is scarce, particularly if it is assessed in Asian countries. Available data suggest that it is known to vary substantially, depending on the country of origin, being particularly high in people coming from countries such as Cambodia (36%) or Latin American countries (26%) [21]. Hospital-based prevalence studies conducted in specialized units have suggested that the prevalence of S.stercoralis is between 4.5% and 11% in migrant populations [22,23,24]. Available data suggest a higher prevalence of infection in immunosuppressed individuals at risk [25,26,27].
Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of S. stercoralis at the hospital level in migrant populations or long-term travelers being attended to in out-patient and in-patient units as part of the systematic screening implemented in six Spanish hospitals."
